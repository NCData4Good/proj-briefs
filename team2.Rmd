## Bringing Bus Stops and Pantries Closer
People who need to get food from food pantries do not always have reliable personal vehicles. 
Are they able to get to the food pantries by using public transportation?
</br>

#### Can people get to food pantries by bus?
We visualized locations of food pantries and bus stops in the four counties
Durham, Johnston, Orange, and Wake. Our analysis shows which pantries have bus
stops within a mile (a 'reasonable' walking distance) of their location.

Limitations:
The distance between pantries and bus stops is calculated as great circle
distance. Obstacles which might increase the actual walking distance (such as
rivers, buildings, walls) were not taken into account. We emphasize that this
analysis does not ask whether there are bus routes from low income areas to food
pantries.	This analysis only addresses whether it is possible for someone
somewhere to travel to pantries in Wake, Durham, Orange and Johnston counties by
bus. Another limitation is that we are missing bus schedules (to determine which
days/hours a bus operates) and hours for food pantries.

library(dplyr)

pantry <- read.csv("pantries.csv",sep=",",header=T, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
pantry <- mutate(pantry,
                 city=as.factor(city),
                 state=as.factor(state),
                 county=as.factor(county))
pantry <- rename(pantry, name=foodpantry) # rename a column
pantry <- subset(pantry,county=c("Wake","Orange","Durham")) %>% droplevels()
# some locations have the same name (edit to ensure uniqueness) 
pantry$name[duplicated(pantry$name)] <- paste(pantry$name[duplicated(pantry$name)],"- Location2")
pantry$category <- as.factor("Pantry")

bus_stop <- readRDS("busstops.rds")
# get rid of empty columns
bus_stop <- select(bus_stop, -c(url, description, parent_station_id, station_id))
bus_stop <- rename(bus_stop, lat=location.lat, lon=location.lng)
bus_stop$category <- as.factor("BusStop")


pantries_and_busstops <- merge(bus_stop, pantry, all=TRUE);
pantries_and_busstops$category_county <- as.factor(
  ifelse(pantries_and_busstops$category=="BusStop",
         "BusStop",
         paste(pantries_and_busstops$category, pantries_and_busstops$county)))
```

The locations of food pantries and bus stops (GoTriangle, GoRaleigh, GoDurham, 
Chapel Hill Transit, NC State University Wolfline, Duke University Transit) 
in the four counties Durham, Johnston, Orange, and Wake:  
Note that Johnston County does not have bus lines except for limited use by 
handicapped and elderly people. 
Including Johnston County there are 169 food pantries, excluding Johnston County 
there are 136 pantries.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
my_color_palette <- colorFactor(c("sandybrown", "turquoise4", "turquoise2", "turquoise3", "darkturquoise"), 
                                domain = sort(levels(pantries_and_busstops$category_county)))
# interactive map of all bus stops and all pantries
mm <- leaflet(data = pantries_and_busstops) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(lat = ~lat, lng = ~lon, 
             group = ~category_county, color = ~my_color_palette(category_county),
             fillOpacity = 0.5, opacity = 0.5,
             popup = ~paste0(category,": ",name)) %>%

                   options=layersControlOptions(collapsed=FALSE)) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = colorFactor(c("darkturquoise","sandybrown"), 
                                             levels = c("Pantry", "Bus Stop")), 
            values = c("Pantry", "Bus Stop"));
mm

# interactive map with icon symbols
my_icons <- iconList(
  BusStop = makeIcon("busstop.png", iconWidth = 12, iconHeight = 12),
  Pantry = makeIcon("pantry.png", iconWidth = 15, iconHeight = 15)
)
mm_icons <- leaflet(data = pantries_and_busstops) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat = ~lat, lng = ~lon, 
             group = ~category_county, 
             popup = ~paste0(category,": ",name),
             icon= ~my_icons[category]) %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups=pantries_and_busstops$category_county,
                   options=layersControlOptions(collapsed=FALSE));
#mm_icons
```

How close is each pantry to the nearest bus stop?  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# get great circle distance between one point and a set of points
MinDistForOneLocation <- function(ID){
 TMP_pantry <- subset(pantry, name==ID);
 TMP_dist <- geosphere::distHaversine(as.matrix(select(TMP_pantry, lon, lat)),
                                      as.matrix(select(bus_stop, lon, lat)));
 TMP_min_dist <- data.frame(pantry_name = ID, 
                    ClosestBusstop = bus_stop[which.min(TMP_dist),"name"],
                    DistanceInMeters = min(TMP_dist),
                    DistanceInMiles = min(TMP_dist)*0.000621371);
 return(TMP_min_dist)
}

DistanceMatrix <- rbind_all(lapply(pantry$name, MinDistForOneLocation)) # in meters and in miles

```


Johnston county has the most room for improvement (since there is no public transportation), 
but lower cost improvement might be in Wake county where there are existing bus lines that could be extended or modified.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# which pantry has a busstop nearby?
pantry <- left_join(pantry, DistanceMatrix, by=c("name"="pantry_name"))
pantry$reach <- factor(ifelse(pantry$DistanceInMiles<0.25,"less than 1/4 mile", 
                              ifelse(pantry$DistanceInMiles<0.5,"less than 1/2 mile", 
                                     ifelse(pantry$DistanceInMiles<1, "less than 1 mile", "more than 1 mile"))),
                       levels=c("less than 1/4 mile", "less than 1/2 mile", "less than 1 mile", "more than 1 mile"),
                       ordered=TRUE);

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(pantry, aes(DistanceInMiles, fill=county, group=county)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  ggtitle("Distance from food pantries to closest bus stop") 
```

86 pantries in the four counties are served by buses (defined as having a bus stop within a 1 mile radius). We found that the vast majorities of food pantries in Durham
County (95%) were served by at least one bus stop within a mile, whereas Orange County only had 67%
of pantries served by bus stops and in Wake County a mere 49% of pantries were served by bus stops.
Johnston County does not have a bus line, so none of its pantries were served by bus stops.
These insights are visualized below.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
my_color_palette <- colorFactor(rev(heat.colors(nlevels(pantry$reach))), 
                                levels = levels(pantry$reach), ordered=TRUE);

mm_pantry <- leaflet(data = pantry) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(lat = ~lat, lng = ~lon, 
             group = ~county, 
             color = ~my_color_palette(reach),
             fillOpacity = 0.5, opacity = 0.5,
             popup = ~paste0(category,": ",name, "\n",
                             "Distance to nearest bus stop: ", 
                             round(DistanceInMiles,2), " mi.")) %>%
  addLegend("bottomleft", pal = my_color_palette, values = ~reach,
            title = "Distance to bus stop",
            opacity = 0.5 ) %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups=pantry$county,
                   options=layersControlOptions(collapsed=FALSE));
mm_pantry
```

Limitations:   
We have merely looked at pantries that have bus stops within less than a mile.
Future analyses should address whether there are bus routes that travel from low income neighborhoods (e.g., by zip codes identified as low income) to the food pantries in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., less than 1 hour).
